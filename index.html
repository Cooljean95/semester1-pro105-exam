            our collective footstep.<br>
            <br>
            Without all that the sea has provided, it would be impossible, and the culmination of our sea resources will

        <h1>Up in The Sky</h1>

        <p>Humankind have always dreamt about flying, like birds. For instance, we have historic stories from the Greek
            legends Icarus and Daedalus, and Vimana in the ancient Indian epics, about humans flying. Now, some
            thousands
            of years later, we have succeeded with this long-lasting human dream.<br>
            <br>
            Our use of sea resources has ultimately made the airplane possible. With the airplane, we can travel great
            distances in a short period of time, making travels across the earth, explorations of every corner of the
            world, and transporting valuable goods across continents achievable in record time.<br>
            <br>
            The first ever manned flight in a motorized plane took place in December 1903, by the Wright brothers, and
            ever
            since, the technology have developed at an incredible speed.</p>

        <h1>Aquatic Animals</h1>

        <p>Aquatic animals are important for several reasons. The integrity of the entire ecosystem depends on the
            interplay between all the different species of life we find in the sea - from coral reefs to bloodthirsty
            sharks. It is key to sustain the life in the sea to sustain our own lives.<br>
            <br>
            The sea is our primary source of protein, and the food the sea serves comes in all shapes and sizes - here
            illustrated with a squid. The importance of seafood stretches from the pure amount of food possible to
            harvest,
            to the health benefits of the consumption of aquatic animals.</p>

            plants, algae, and bacteria?<br>
            <br>
            The mining of petroleum is a great technological achievement, which in return has given us countless other

        <p>Underwater volcanos, or submarine volcanos, are underwater vents in Earth's surface from which magma can
            erupt. They make up around 75 % of the yearly emission of magma on earth.<br>
            <br>
            This sounds terrifying, and it surely is, but in reality they also play a vital role for us and the rest of
            life on the planet. They are namely responsible of an unusual chemical cycle where mineral-rich emissions
            are
            emitted, and these minerals ultimately <i>sustains life!</i></p>

        <h1>The depth of Titanic</h1>

        <p>Transport and travel by the seaway has been the main means of intercontinental travel for several thousands
            of years, and still prevails today as among the most important transportation methods, of both commodities
            and
            people. In fact, the oldest boat ever found is around 10 000 years old! But still, while having several
            thousand years' experience travelling on the sea, sea-travel is dangerous, and even unsinkable ships may
            sink.
            The sea gives, and the sea takes.<br>
            <br>
            RMS Titanic was a British passenger ship which sank in the North Atlantic Ocean in 1912, after striking an
            iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. Of the estimated 2,224 people aboard,
            more
            than 1,500 died, making the sinking the deadliest of a single ship in the West, at the time. The wreck of
            the
            RMS Titanic lies at a depth of about 3800m, about 600km south-southeast off the coast of Newfoundland.</p>
